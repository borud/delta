# Delta Robot Forward and Inverse Kinematics

**This is a work in progress so please do not assume this is correct.
Any mistakes in the code are most likely mine.**

This code is a port to Golang of the code found at the [Marginally
Clever](https://www.marginallyclever.com/other/samples/fk-ik-test.html)
blog, which is in turn sample code from the [Trossen
Robotics](http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/tutorials/introduction-129/delta-robot-kinematics-3276/)
forum] (*sadly the link doesn't work at the time of writing*).

I've made some small changes to the code which produces slightly
different numeric values if compared to the JS code.  I am not yet
sure if this is because I have made a mistake or if it is due to using
higher precision constants.
